* Decompose function should generate locations, in case downstream meta-encodings rely on it


* Fix meta-telingo external generation to handle pools and intervals as well.

* Change reified facts to be within ast/1 "namespace"
This will allow us to avoid wrapping the facts int ast() at each time step, saving some grounding time. Will make it a bit more annoying to write transform encodings, but oh well.

* Change idenfier of facts to also be "typed"
e.g. instead of =string(1,"hello")= we would have =string(string(1),"hello")=
While this might duplicate information a bit, it allows us for example to write bodies like
=terms(T,Pos,S), string(S,"hello")=
instead of
=terms(T,Pos,string(S)), string(S,"hello")=
While this may seem like a minor benefit, the latter solution becomes more and more unwieldy with longer predicate names.
